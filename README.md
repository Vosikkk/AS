# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the programming puzzles from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve a series of small programming puzzles, each designed to be solvable in a short amount of time.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is created by [Eric Wastl](https://adventofcode.com/), and it consists of daily puzzles released during the month of December. The puzzles cover various programming concepts and difficulty levels, making them suitable for a wide range of skill sets.
